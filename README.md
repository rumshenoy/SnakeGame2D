# Snake2D - Work in Progress

### Description:
This is a basic snake game with three levels. Each level has different obstacles. There are two directions you can maneover the snake in - left and right. This was one of the assignments in a course (CS 175) I had taken at San Jose State University.I am currently working on refactoring it to make it more perfect.
